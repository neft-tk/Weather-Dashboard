# Weather-Dashboard
Weather dashboard that displays 6 total days of weather (with details) for a selected city. Displays multiple details such as the date, temperature, the wind speed, the humidity, and an icon for the forecast. 

To the side there is a search history list which displays previous searches as buttons that will run the original weather function with that button's stored value.

I was unable to complete the functions that would display weather data at this time.
